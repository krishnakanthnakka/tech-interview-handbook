One of my top reasons for recommending Python is that it uses consistent APIs that operate on different data structures, such as ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"len()"),", ",Object(o.b)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"for ... in ...")," and slicing notation on sequences (strings/lists/tuples).

If you need to use a data structure that the language does not support, such as a Queue or Heap in JavaScript, perhaps try asking the interviewer whether you can assume that you have a data structure that implements certain methods with specified time complexities. If the implementation of that data structure is not crucial to solving the problem, the interviewer will usually allow this.
